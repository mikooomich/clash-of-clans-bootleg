How to play the game

You will start with a lvl 1 Village hall and the building, and an amount of resources.
You must buy your buildings first. Use the "shop buy x" command  ("shop buyall" will buy all buildings in catalog, this is a cheat you can conviently abuse)
Your buildings will not be placed automatically, use the editor commands to place stuff.
Shop and editor have commands to get what is available, see manual for full list of commands.

Searching for new villages to attack: use next command until found a desirable village, will generate your equivalent village hall of village.
Initiate the attack with attack command or simulate a defence with the simdefence command.
